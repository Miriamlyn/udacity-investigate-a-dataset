# TMDB MOVIE ANALYSIS
## by Chimamaka Chilaka


## Dataset

> The Dataset contains 10,000 rows of informations collected from a movie database and has information such as ratings, revenue.

## Installation

The libraries/packages used for this project includes;

Pandas: For manipulating structured data
Numpy: dealing with multi-dimensional arrays.
Matplotlib: For visualization

## Project methodology
The project was carried out using the 5 stages of Data analysis.

Data Wrangling
Assessing Data
Cleaning Data
Exploratory Analysis
Conclusion

The analysis is focused on answering questions such as:
> What is the Title of the most popular movie?
> What is the corelation between movie revenue and ratings(vote_count)?
> Do movies with high bubget generate more revenue than those with lower budget(What is the corelation)?
> What kind of properties are associatied with movies with high revenue?


## Summary of Findings
Based on the analysis carried out, the below observations were made;

> The top 5 movies with highest budget are not among the top 5 with highest revenue
> The most poular movie title is Jurrasic World
> There seem to be no corelation between vote count and Revenue
> There might be certain limitation with the dataset as the movie with low revenue have a budget of about 5 million compared to the movie with high revenue which has 52 plus million as budget. This shows a correlation which was not present in question 4. We believe that other factors might be contributing to this difference.

## Limitations

> Although there seems to be a correlation between likes and retweets, I am unable to confirm causation.
> I intially had four sources of tweets which was reduced to three during the cleaning stages.
> I am unable to confirm if type of phone has a directly correlation to retweet and favorite count(like)
> In the course of cleaning, a particular source "Vine: make a scene" was eliminated and as such, the analysis done is just a representation of a total sample collection.
